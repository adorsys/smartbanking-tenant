# Smartbanking Platform Tenant Library

## Idea
We provide base classes and utilities to model hierarchical multi-tenant setups
along with users and permissions.

## Technical
The library aims to be as tech-agnostic as possible. Only hard dependency should
be morphia/mongodb.

The sample application is based on spring boot/data/security.
